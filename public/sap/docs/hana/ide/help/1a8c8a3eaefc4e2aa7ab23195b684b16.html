	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The OData service definition is the mechanism you use to define what data to expose with
		OData, how, and to whom. Data exposed as an OData collection is available for analysis and
		display by client applications, for example, a browser that uses functions provided by an
		OData client library running on the client system.</p>

		<p class="p">To expose information by means of OData to applications using <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> XS, you
			must define database views that provide the data with the required granularity. Then you
			create an OData service definition, which is a file you use to specify which database
			views or tables are exposed as OData collections. </p>

		<div class="note note" id="loio1a8c8a3eaefc4e2aa7ab23195b684b16__note_N1001D_N10012_N10001"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> XS supports OData version 2.0, which
			you can use to send OData queries (for example, using the HTTP <samp class="ph codeph">GET</samp>
			method). Language encoding is restricted to UTF-8.</div>

		<p class="p">An OData service for <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> XS is defined in a text file with the file suffix
				<samp class="ph codeph">.xsodata</samp>, for example, <samp class="ph codeph">OdataSrvDef.xsodata</samp>. The
			file must contain at least the entry  <samp class="ph codeph">service {}</samp>, which would generate
			a completely operational OData service with an empty service catalog and an empty
			metadata file. However, usually you use the service definition to expose objects in the
			database catalog, for example: tables, SQL views, or calculation rules.</p>

		<p class="p">In the OData service-definition file, you can use the following ways to name the
				<span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> objects you want to expose by OData:</p>

		<div class="note note" id="loio1a8c8a3eaefc4e2aa7ab23195b684b16__note_N10045_N10012_N10001"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> The syntax to use in the OData service-definition file to reference objects depends on
			the object type, for example, repository (design-time) or database catalog
			(runtime).</div>

		<ul class="ul" id="loio1a8c8a3eaefc4e2aa7ab23195b684b16__ul_qnk_wtm_sh">
			<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Repository objects</strong><p class="p">Expose an object using the object's repository (design-time) name
					in the OData service-definition file. This method of exposing database objects
					using OData enables the OData service to be automatically updated if the
					underlying repository object changes. Note that a design-time name can be used
					to reference analytic and calculation views; it cannot be used to reference SQL
					views. The following example shows how to include a reference to a table in an
					OData service definition using the table's <span class="keyword">design-time</span>
					name.</p>
<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">service {
    "acme.com.odata::myTable" as "myTable";
}</pre></div>
<div class="note note" id="loio1a8c8a3eaefc4e2aa7ab23195b684b16__note_N1005E_N1004E_N1004A_N10012_N10001"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> Calculation views are only
					accessible from within <span class="ph filepath">xsodata</span> files by referring to the
					design-time name. However, it is recommended to use design-time names whenever
					possible for calculation views or common tables. With design-time names, the
					cross references are recreated during activation (for example, for where-used),
					which means changes are visible automatically. </div>
</li>

			<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Database objects</strong><p class="p">Expose an object using the object's database catalog (runtime)
					name. The support for database objects is mainly intended for existing or
					replicated objects that do not have a repository design-time representation. The
					following example shows how to include a reference to a table in an OData
					service definition using the table's <span class="keyword">runtime</span>
					name.</p>
<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">service {
    "mySchema"."myTable" as "MyTable";
}</pre></div>
<div class="note note" id="loio1a8c8a3eaefc4e2aa7ab23195b684b16__note_N10077_N10067_N1004A_N10012_N10001"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> It is strongly recommended not to
					use catalog (runtime) names in an OData service-definition. The use of catalog
					object names is only enabled in a service-definition because some objects do not
					have a design-time name. If at all possible, use the design-time name to
					reference objects in an OData service-definition file.</div>
</li>

		</ul>

		<p class="p">By default, all entity sets and associations in an OData service are writeable, that is
			they can be modified with a CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE requests. However, you can prevent
			the execution of a modification request by setting the appropriate keyword
				(<span class="keyword">create</span>, <span class="keyword">update</span>, or <span class="keyword">delete</span>)
			with the <samp class="ph codeph">forbidden</samp> option in the OData service definition. The
			following example of an OData service definition for <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> XS shows
			how to prevent any modification to the table <span class="ph filepath">myTable</span> that is
			exposed by the OData service. Any attempt to make a modification to the indicated table
			using a CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE request results in the HTTP response status
				<samp class="ph systemoutput">403 FORBIDDEN</samp>.</p>

		<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">service {
     “sap.test::myTable”
          create forbidden
          update forbidden
          delete forbidden;
}
</pre></div>

		<p class="p">For CREATE requests, for example, to add a new entry to either a table or an SQL view exposed
			by an OData service, you must specify an explicit key (not a generated key); the key
			must be included in the URL as part of the CREATE request. For UPDATE and DELETE
			requests, you do not need to specify the key explicitly (and if you do, it will be
			ignored); the key is already known, since it is essential to specify which entry in the
			table or SQL view must be modified with the UPDATE or DELETE request. </p>

		<div class="note note" id="loio1a8c8a3eaefc4e2aa7ab23195b684b16__note_N100A6_N10012_N10001"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> Without any support for IN/OUT table parameters in SQLScript,
			it is not possible to use a sequence to create an entry in a table or view exposed by an
			OData service. However, you can use XS JavaScript exits to update a table with a
			generated value.</div>
