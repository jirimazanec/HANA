		<p class="p">The motivation for SQLScript is to embed data-intensive application logic into the database. As
			of today, applications only offload very limited functionality into the database using
			SQL, most of the application logic is normally executed on an application server. The
			effect of that is that data to be operated upon needs to be copied from the database
			onto the application server and vice versa. When executing data intensive logic, this
			copying of data can be very expensive in terms of processor and data transfer time.
			Moreover, when using an imperative language like ABAP or JAVA for processing data,
			developers tend to write algorithms which follow a one-tuple-at-a-time semantics (for
			example, looping over rows in a table). However, these algorithms are hard to optimize
			and parallelize compared to declarative set-oriented languages like SQL.</p>

		<p class="p">The SAP HANA database is optimized for modern technology trends and takes advantage of modern
			hardware, for example, by having data residing in the main memory and allowing massive
			parallelization on multi-core CPUs. The goal of the SAP HANA database is to support
			application requirements by making use of such hardware. The SAP HANA database exposes a
			very sophisticated interface to the application, consisting of many languages. The
			expressiveness of these languages far exceeds that attainable with OpenSQL. The set of
			SQL extensions for the SAP HANA database, which allows developers to push data-intensive
			logic to the database, is called SQLScript. Conceptually SQLScript is related to stored
			procedures as defined in the SQL standard, but SQLScript is designed to provide superior
			optimization possibilities. SQLScript should be used in cases where other modeling
			constructs of SAP HANA, for example analytic views or attribute views are not
			sufficient. For more information on how to best exploit the different view types, see
			"Exploit Underlying Engine".</p>

		<p class="p">The set of SQL extensions are the key to avoid massive data copies to the application server
			and for leveraging sophisticated parallel execution strategies of the database.
			SQLScript addresses the following problems:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loio297af2926307446cbbfb1a8f96fec941__ul_z13_kjv_vh">
			<li class="li">Decomposing an SQL query can only be done using views. However when decomposing complex
				queries using views, all intermediate results are visible and must be explicitly
				typed. Moreover SQL views cannot be parameterized which limits their reuse. In
				particular they can only be used like tables and embedded into other SQL statements. </li>

			<li class="li">SQL queries do not have features to express business logic (for example a complex currency
				conversion). As a consequence such a business logic cannot be pushed down into the
				database (even if it is mainly based on standard aggregations like SUM(Sales),
				etc.). </li>

			<li class="li">An SQL query can only return one result at a time. As a consequence the computation
				of related result sets must be split into separate, usually unrelated, queries.</li>

			<li class="li">As SQLScript encourages developers to implement algorithms using a set-oriented paradigm and
				not using a one tuple at a time paradigm, imperative logic is required, for example
				by iterative approximation algorithms. Thus it is possible to mix imperative
				constructs known from stored procedures with declarative ones.</li>
