	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Object Privileges</h1>

	
	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Object privileges are SQL privileges that are used to allow access to and modification
		of database objects.</p>

		<div class="section">
			<p class="p">For each SQL statement type (for example, SELECT, UPDATE, or CALL), a corresponding
				object privilege exists. If a user wants to execute a particular statement on a
				simple database object (for example, a table), he or she must have the corresponding
				object privilege for either the actual object itself, or the schema in which the
				object is located. This is because the schema is an object type that contains other
				objects. A user who has object privileges for a schema automatically has the same
				privileges for all objects currently in the schema and any objects created there in
				the future.</p>

			<p class="p">Object privileges are not only grantable for database catalog objects such as tables,
				views and procedures. Object privileges can also be granted for non-catalog objects
				such as development objects in the repository of the SAP HANA database.</p>

			<p class="p">Initially, the owner of an object and the owner of the schema in which the object is
				located are the only users who can access the object and grant object privileges on
				it to other users.</p>

			<p class="p">An object can therefore be accessed only by the following users:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loiod6311b15a7e74e01b3f660f7d175b318__ul_jfl_j2v_nl">
				<li class="li">The owner of the object</li>

				<li class="li">The owner of the schema in which the object is located</li>

				<li class="li">Users to whom the owner of the object has granted privileges</li>

				<li class="li">Users to whom the owner of the parent schema has granted privileges</li>

			</ul>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> The database owner concept stipulates that when a database user is
				deleted, all objects created by that user and privileges granted to others by that
				user are also deleted. If the owner of a schema is deleted, all objects in the
				schema are also deleted even if they are owned by a different user. All privileges
				on these objects are also deleted.</div>

			
		</div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Authorization Check on Objects with Dependencies</div><div type="Authorization Check on Objects with Dependencies"><p class="p">The authorization check
				for objects defined on other objects (that is, stored procedures and views) is more
				complex. In order to be able to access an object with dependencies, both of the
				following conditions must be met:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loiod6311b15a7e74e01b3f660f7d175b318__ul_rg5_1hv_nl">
				<li class="li">The user trying to access the object must have the relevant object privilege on
					the object as described above.</li>

				<li class="li">The user who created the object must have the required privilege on all underlying objects
						<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">and</span> be authorized to grant this privilege to
					others.</li>

			</ul>
<p class="p">If this second condition is not met, only the owner of the object can access it.
				He cannot grant privileges on it to any other user. This cannot be circumvented by
				granting privileges on the parent schema instead. Even if a user has privileges on
				the schema, he will still not be able to access the object.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> This applies to
				procedures created in DEFINER mode only. This means that the authorization check is
				run against the privileges of the user who created the object, not the user
				accessing the object. For procedures created in INVOKER mode, the authorization
				check is run against the privileges of the accessing user. In this case, the user
				must have privileges not only on the object itself but on all objects that it
				uses.</div>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip</span> The SAP HANA studio provides a graphical feature, the authorization dependency
				viewer, to help troubleshoot authorization errors for object types that typically
				have complex dependency structures: stored procedures and calculation views.</div>
