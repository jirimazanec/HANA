		<p class="p">The following list illustrates the areas where special attention is required to avoid
			security-related problems when writing server-side JavaScript. Each of the problems
			highlighted in the list is described in detail in its own dedicated section:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loiob5e65421b48c48fa87312a6023f4c414__ul_asc_y4s_p3">
			<li class="li">SSL/HTTPS<p class="p">Enable secure HTTP (HTTPS) for inbound communication required by an <span class="ph pname">SAP
						HANA</span> application.</p>
</li>

			<li class="li">Injection flaws<p class="p">In the context of <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> Extended Application Services
						(<span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> XS) injection flaws concern SQL injection that
					modifies the URL to expand the scope of the original request.</p>
</li>

			<li class="li">Cross-site scripting (XSS)<p class="p"> Web-based vulnerability that involves an attacker
					injecting JavaScript into a link with the intention of running the injected code
					on the target computer.</p>
</li>

			<li class="li">Broken authentication and session management<p class="p">Leaks or flaws in the authentication
					or session management functions allow attackers to impersonate users and gain
					access to unauthorized systems and data.</p>
</li>

			<li class="li">Insecure direct object references<p class="p">An application lacks the proper authentication mechanism
					for target objects.</p>
</li>

			<li class="li">Cross-site request forgery (XSRF)<p class="p">Exploits the trust boundaries that exist between
					different Web sites running in the same web browser session.</p>
</li>

			<li class="li">Incorrect security configuration<p class="p">Attacks against the security configuration in
					place, for example, authentication mechanisms and authorization processes.
				</p>
</li>

			<li class="li">Insecure cryptographic storage<p class="p">Sensitive information such as logon credentials is not
					securely stored, for example, with encryption tools.</p>
</li>

			<li class="li">Missing restrictions on URL Access<p class="p">Sensitive information such as logon credentials
					is exposed.</p>
</li>

			<li class="li">Insufficient transport layer protection<p class="p">Network traffic can be monitored, and
					attackers can steal sensitive information such as logon credentials or
					credit-card data.</p>
</li>

			<li class="li">Invalid redirects and forwards<p class="p">Web applications redirect users to other pages or
					use internal forwards in a similar manner. </p>
</li>

			<li class="li">XML processing issues<p class="p">Potential security issues related to processing XML as input
