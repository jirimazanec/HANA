<div class="section"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Coding Samples</span><p class="p">Any software coding and/or code lines / strings
                ("Code") included in this documentation are only examples and are not intended to be
                used in a productive system environment. The Code is only intended to better explain
                and visualize the syntax and phrasing rules of certain coding. SAP does not warrant
                the correctness and completeness of the Code given herein, and SAP shall not be
                liable for errors or damages caused by the usage of the Code, unless damages were

<div class="section"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Accessibility</span><p class="p">The information contained in the SAP documentation
                represents SAP's current view of accessibility criteria as of the date of
                publication; it is in no way intended to be a binding guideline on how to ensure
                accessibility of software products. SAP specifically disclaims any liability with
                respect to this document and no contractual obligations or commitments are formed
                either directly or indirectly by this document. </p>

<div class="section"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Gender-Neutral Language</span><p class="p">As far as possible, SAP documentation is
                gender neutral. Depending on the context, the reader is addressed directly with
                "you", or a gender-neutral noun (such as "sales person" or "working days") is used.
                If when referring to members of both sexes, however, the third-person singular
                cannot be avoided or a gender-neutral noun does not exist, SAP reserves the right to
                use the masculine form of the noun and pronoun. This is to ensure that the
                documentation remains comprehensible. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Internet Hyperlinks</span><p class="p">The SAP documentation may contain hyperlinks
                to the Internet. These hyperlinks are intended to serve as a hint about where to
                find related information. SAP does not warrant the availability and correctness of
                this related information or the ability of this information to serve a particular
                purpose. SAP shall not be liable for any damages caused by the use of related
                information unless damages have been caused by SAP's gross negligence or willful
                misconduct. Regarding link classification, see: <a class="xref" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer/" target="_blank">http://help.sap.com/disclaimer</a></p>
