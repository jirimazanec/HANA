								<p class="p">You can use native <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> transport to transport

									<p class="p">With native <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> transport, performing an
										import means that you are on the target system and you pull
										an export from the source system using a configured
										transport route. Therefore, each import in a production
										system triggers a separate export from the test system. If
										you have multiple production systems, you must ensure that
										the test system remains unchanged while you are performing
										imports in the production systems. If the test system
										changes during this process, then the multiple imports into
										several production systems can result in different states of
										the software in these systems. Bear in mind that you need to
										trigger the import separately on each target system.</p>

									<p class="p">If you cannot guarantee that the test system remains
										unchanged, you can opt to assemble the development into an
										installable archive on the test system, and install it in
										the production systems, as described in the
