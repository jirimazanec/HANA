			<p class="p">If you transport the complete DU or all changelists of a DU, all active objects of packages
				that are assigned to the DU are exported into a DU archive
					(<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">.tgz</span> file). When the archive is
				imported in the target system, the objects that are part of the DU in the target
				system are overwritten by the content of the DU archive. If the imported DU contains
				fewer packages than the same DU on the target system, because some packages were
				unassigned from the DU (or re-assigned to another DU), the objects that are part of
				the missing packages will be deleted on the target system. The packages will be
				unassigned from the DU on the target system and are empty afterwards.</p>

			<p class="p">The following example illustrates this behavior for the transport of a complete DU or
				all changelists of a DU.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="example"><h2 class="exampletitle">Example</h2>
			<p class="p">DU <samp class="ph codeph">DEMO_DU</samp> contains the following objects in the target system:</p>

				<li class="li">Package <samp class="ph codeph">demo.ccc</samp> with object <samp class="ph codeph">CCC.xsjs</samp></li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">The transport of the DU archive of <samp class="ph codeph">DEMO_DU</samp> contains the following objects:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio10790ebc5fff439c8fb9a17abe98f388__ul_mfm_zdy_xr">
				<li class="li">Package <samp class="ph codeph">demo.aaa</samp> with objects <samp class="ph codeph">AAA.xsjs</samp>
				</li>

				<li class="li">Package <samp class="ph codeph">demo.bbb</samp> with object <samp class="ph codeph">BBB.xsjs</samp></li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">When the archive is imported in the target system, the following objects are deleted:</p>

			<div class="p">So the final state of DU <samp class="ph codeph">DEMO_DU</samp> on the target system is the

		<div class="section"><p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Dependencies of objects between DUs can cause activation
				errors</span></p>
For native <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> transport the following is
			valid: If objects of one DU have dependencies on objects of another DU, then you must
			make sure that the dependent object is imported either at the same time or later than
			the object on which it depends. Otherwise, the dependent object cannot be activated in
			the target system and the import will be rolled back. If you have circular dependencies,
			the dependent DUs must be imported simultaneously so that all objects can be activated
					successfully.<div class="note sap-example example"><span class="exampletitle">Example</span> <samp class="ph codeph">DEMO_DU</samp> contains privileges
					(<samp class="ph codeph">demo.aaa.xsprivileges</samp>). Application
					<samp class="ph codeph">demo.bbb.Tester.hdbrole</samp> is part of DU
					<samp class="ph codeph">INTERNAL_DEMO_DU</samp> and refers to the privileges of
					<samp class="ph codeph">DEMO_DU</samp>. If the DU <samp class="ph codeph">INTERNAL_DEMO_DU</samp> is
				transported first, activation would fail because the required
					<samp class="ph codeph">.xsprivileges</samp> object is not yet in the target system.<p class="p">To
					avoid this situation, assign both DUs to the same transport route and perform
					the import for both DUs at the same time. Alternatively, make sure that you
					import <samp class="ph codeph">DEMO_DU</samp> before you import
						<samp class="ph codeph">INTERNAL_DEMO_DU</samp>.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">If you use CTS
				transport, SAP recommends that you assign DUs to the same transport request if
				objects in one DU have dependencies on objects in the other DU. Alternatively, you
				can import the transport request that contains the dependent object later than the
				transport request that contains the object on which it depends. However, if neither
				option is possible, the transport request that contains the dependent object will
				still be imported with CTS transport. If it is transported earlier than the object
				on which it depends, the job completes with return code 8, as described above. The
				dependent object will remain broken in the system. As soon as a transport request
				brings the object on which it depends, the broken object will be activated
				automatically.</p>
