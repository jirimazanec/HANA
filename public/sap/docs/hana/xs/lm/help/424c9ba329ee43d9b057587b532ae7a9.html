		for the <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> platform.</p>

		<p class="p">For example, you need to plan, manage, and maintain the application versions you want to

		<p class="p"><span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> application lifecycle management uses the delivery unit (DU) as a vehicle to ship one or more software components from
			SAP (or a partner) to a customer. Delivery units correspond to an "application" with versions, for which support packages and patches are
			delivered. You can also use the delivery unit to transport content between <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> systems, for example, between
			development systems or between development and production systems.</p>

					<span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> repository. As an application developer, you check out
				design-time content from the repository and edit a copy of the checked-out artifact
				in the local file system on your personal computer (PC). The following steps provide
				a brief, high-level overview of the development lifecycle for design-time
