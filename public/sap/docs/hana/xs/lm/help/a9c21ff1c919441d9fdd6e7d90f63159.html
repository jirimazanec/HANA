                                environment for application development: SAP HANA extended
                                application services (XS), advanced model. SAP HANA XS advanced
                                model represents an evolution of the application server architecture
                                within SAP HANA by building upon the strengths (and expanding the
                                scope) of SAP HANA extended application services (XS), classic
                                model. SAP recommends that customers and partners who want to
                                develop new applications use SAP HANA XS advanced model. If you want
                                to migrate existing XS classic applications to run in the new XS
                                advanced run-time environment, SAP recommends that you first check
                                the features available with the installed version of XS advanced; if
                                the XS advanced features match the requirements of the XS classic
                                application you want to migrate, then you can start the migration
                                process.</span></div>
