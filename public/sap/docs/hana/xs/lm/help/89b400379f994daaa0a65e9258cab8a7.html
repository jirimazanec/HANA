	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Technical Details of Initial Change Recording Setup</h1>

	
	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">When you enable change recording in <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> Application Lifecycle Management, all active objects of the system are
		included in a base changelist.</p>

		<p class="p">You should enable change recording in development systems. These are the source systems for
			transports. To guarantee a consistent system state, SAP recommends that you enable
			change recording <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">before</span> you start your development activities. </p>

		<p class="p">Change recording is intended to be enabled one time when the system is set up. It is not
			intended to be enabled and disabled multiple times for a system. For compatibility
			reasons, change recording is disabled initially when a new system is installed. If you
			want to use it, enable it in <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> Application Lifecycle Management
			and continue using it.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">You can also start using change recording at a later point in time during your development
				process, for example, after performing an upgrade.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="p">When you select the checkbox to enable change recording, all active objects of the system that belong to packages assigned to a delivery unit
			(DU) are added to an initial changelist. This process is called creating a <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">base changelist</span>. Depending on the point in
			time when change recording is enabled, creating the base changelist can take some time. </p>

		<p class="p">This base changelist is not visible in the system. However, when the first changelist is
			transported for a DU that contains real changes, the base changelist with all active
			objects of packages that are assigned to the DU is also transported to the target
			system. This ensures that the target system has exactly the same state as the source
			system.</p>

		<div class="note sap-example example"><span class="exampletitle">Example</span> 
			<p class="p">DU <samp class="ph codeph">ABC</samp> contains one hundred objects at the time when change recording is
				enabled. All one hundred objects are included in the base changelist and will be
				released with it. After you enable change recording, you modify one object of DU
					<samp class="ph codeph">ABC</samp> and you assign it to a changelist. Then you release the
				changelist and transport it. Even though the changelist that you release and
				transport only contains one modified object, all the one hundred objects of the
				released base changelist that are part of DU <samp class="ph codeph">ABC</samp> are also included
				in this first transport.</p>

			<p class="p">If you use CTS transport, you can see the DU archive of the base changelist that contains the complete DU as an additional
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">.tgz</span> file next to the <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">.tgz</span> file created for the
				changelist in Transport Organizer Web UI. If you use native <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> transport, the base changelist is not visible in
				the transport.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="p">Since enabling change recording means that all active objects of the system that belong to
			packages assigned to a DU are initially transported to the target system, you should
			make sure beforehand that you actually want to have all objects that are part of the DU
			in the source system also available in the target system. For example, some test objects
			or local objects may exist that you do not require in the target system. Therefore,
			check in your development environment for each delivery unit whether there are packages
			or objects that you want to remove from the delivery unit before enabling change
			recording.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">The point in time is important when the transport (native <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> transport)
				or export (CTS transport) of the first changelist is performed. If change recording
				was enabled when the DU was empty, but the transport (native <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span>
				transport) or export (CTS transport) is executed when packages are assigned to the
				DU, all the objects that belong to packages assigned to the DU are transported in
				the base changelist along with the first changed object.</p>
