	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">In general, we recommend that you assign objects of packages assigned to only one
		delivery unit (DU) to a changelist to ensure consistent transport of all objects in the
		changelist. </p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">The following recommendations are valid for the native SAP HANA transport of changelists, both
				for the transport modes <span class="ph uicontrol">Selected Changelists</span> and
					<span class="ph uicontrol">All Changelists</span>. </p>

			<p class="p">For CTS transport, you must make sure that all objects that you want to transport belong to
				packages in DUs that are assigned to CTS transport. If a DU is not assigned to CTS
				transport, the related objects are not transported and you are not notified about
				this.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="p">We recommend that you make sure that all objects of a changelist are transported on one
			transport route. To ensure this, the following prerequisites must be met: <ul class="ul" id="loio44a2013f2b8142fbb7285e99ce933544__ul_x1c_t3s_2v">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">All objects in the changelist must be assigned to packages that are assigned
						to a delivery unit (DU).</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">The transport route must be configured for this DU.</p>

				</li>

			</ul>
</div>

		<p class="p">In this case, all objects of the changelist are transported when you start the transport on
			this transport route, and the changelist will no longer be offered for transport.</p>

		<div class="example"><h2 class="exampletitle">Example</h2>DU <samp class="ph codeph">A</samp> has the package <samp class="ph codeph">aaa</samp> assigned to it and DU
				<samp class="ph codeph">B</samp> has the package <samp class="ph codeph">B</samp> assigned to it. Transport
			route <samp class="ph codeph">TAB</samp> is configured for DUs <samp class="ph codeph">A</samp> and
				<samp class="ph codeph">B</samp>. Changelist <samp class="ph codeph">CL1</samp> contains objects of packages
				<samp class="ph codeph">aaa</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">bbb</samp>. When you transport changelist
				<samp class="ph codeph">CL1</samp> on transport route <samp class="ph codeph">TAB</samp>, all objects that are
			part of this changelist are transported. </div>

		<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Problems if the objects in one changelist are transported on different transport
				routes</span></p>

		<p class="p">If for some reason there are objects of packages of more than one DU in the same
			changelist and you use a transport route that is not configured for all DUs, only the
			objects in the packages of the assigned DU will be transported. The objects in the other
			DUs will not be transported on this transport route.</p>

		<p class="p">In this case, you must transport the changelist on both transport routes to make sure that all
			objects are transported. Depending on the transport route, only objects in packages of
			the assigned DU are transported.</p>

		<div class="example"><h2 class="exampletitle">Example</h2>DU A has the package <samp class="ph codeph">aaa</samp> assigned to it, DU <samp class="ph codeph">B</samp> has the
			package <samp class="ph codeph">bbb</samp> assigned to it, and DU <samp class="ph codeph">C</samp> has the package
				<samp class="ph codeph">ccc</samp> assigned to it. Transport route <samp class="ph codeph">TAB</samp> is
			configured for DUs <samp class="ph codeph">A</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">B</samp>. Transport route
				<samp class="ph codeph">C</samp> is configured for DU <samp class="ph codeph">C</samp>. Changelist
				<samp class="ph codeph">CL2</samp> contains objects of packages <samp class="ph codeph">aaa</samp>,
				<samp class="ph codeph">bbb</samp>, and <samp class="ph codeph">ccc</samp>. When you start the transport for
			changelist <samp class="ph codeph">CL2</samp> on transport route <samp class="ph codeph">TAB</samp>, all objects of
			the DUs <samp class="ph codeph">A</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">B</samp> (packages <samp class="ph codeph">aaa</samp> and
				<samp class="ph codeph">bbb</samp>) are transported. Objects of DU <samp class="ph codeph">C</samp> (package
				<samp class="ph codeph">ccc</samp>) are not transported on this transport route. However, when you
			start the transport of selected changelists on transport route <samp class="ph codeph">C</samp>, the
			changelist is offered for transport. Only objects of DU <samp class="ph codeph">C</samp> (package
				<samp class="ph codeph">ccc</samp>) will be transported. When you start the transport of all
			changelists on transport route <samp class="ph codeph">C</samp>, the complete DU <samp class="ph codeph">C</samp>
			will be transported.</div>

		<div class="note sap-recommendation recommendation"><span class="recommendationtitle">Recommendation</span> 
			<p class="p">We do not recommend that the transport is distributed on different transport routes.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="p">If you are in the situation that you have configured different transport routes for different
			DUs and you cannot transport all objects of the changelist in one transport, we
			recommend that you proceed as follows: To make sure that all objects are transported on
			the same transport route, re-assign all packages with related developments to the same
			DU. Keep in mind the <cite class="cite">Consequences of Package - DU Reassignments</cite> (The link
			is in the <cite class="cite">Related Information</cite>.). </p>

		<p class="p">Only if you cannot assign all related packages to the same DU, you can configure the transport
			route for multiple DUs to make sure that the objects of related developments are
			transported together.</p>
