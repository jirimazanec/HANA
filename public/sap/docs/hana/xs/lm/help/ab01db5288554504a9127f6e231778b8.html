			<p class="p">In short, you use native <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> transport to transport only <span class="ph pname">SAP
					HANA</span> objects, especially if you want to use <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span>
				transports out-of-the-box with little configuration effort. You use CTS transport to
				transport <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> content if you already use CTS for other
				transports.</p>

			<p class="p">For more information on when to use which mode, see <a class="xref" href="default.html?91f4bf31ae2f4457819c79c3ce741e83.html" target="_top" title="When you develop SAP HANA applications, you must decide on the transport scenario that you want to use and its impact on the setup of the transport landscape, as well as on whether or not you want to use change recording.">Transport Scenarios in SAP HANA Application Lifecycle Management</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">If you only want to transport the content of one or multiple independent DUs, you can use DU
				transport. Doing this means that you save organizational overhead because you do not
				have to enter all the metadata that is required on product level.</p>

			<p class="p">If there are complex dependencies between DUs, or if multiple DUs are to be distributed as a
				whole, you can model and transport products. You can maintain metadata for products
				and thus transport a well-defined state. Bear in mind that only native <span class="ph pname">SAP
					HANA</span> transport supports the transport of products currently. If you use
				CTS transport, you <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">cannot</span> transport products. You can assemble
				products and install them using the <samp class="ph codeph">hdbalm</samp> commandline tool,
				however.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">How can I perform a top-down approach in development when empty packages cannot be transported when change recording is enabled? What needs to be considered in the bottom-up approach?</div><div type="How can I perform a top-down approach in development when empty packages cannot be transported when change recording is enabled? What needs to be considered in the bottom-up approach?">
			
			<p class="p">In a top-down development approach, the project responsible provides and models the
				development infrastructure before development starts their work. That is, the
				responsible creates containers for development, such as products, product instances,
				or delivery units, and assigns packages, provides users, and so on. This preparatory
				work also includes configuring the transport infrastructure, and in this process, it
				might involve simulating a transport. However, when change recording is enabled, you
				cannot transport empty packages. Transport is only possible if there is at least one
				package that contains at least one object.</p>

			<p class="p">If you want to realize the top-down approach, you can create a test application with initial
				content. For example, <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> Web-based Development Workbench
				includes a wizard for creating applications and automatically generates the
				application-descriptors that are required for the <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span>
				application (<samp class="ph codeph">.xsapp</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">.xsaccess</samp> files). You can
				then test that the application can be transported through the landscape.</p>

			<p class="p">In a bottom-up approach, development starts developing in packages without creating any
				metadata. These development artifacts can be activated and deployed. However, they
				cannot be transported since the transport tools do not support the transport of
				packages without metadata. As a prerequisite for the transport, a container must
				exist, such as a delivery unit or a product, to which the packages that you want to
				transport are assigned.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">I forgot to assign a package to my DU and I changed objects that are recorded and released in a changelist.

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
				<p class="p">If you transport this changelist again, all the other objects in the DU that are part of this
					changelist will be imported again. In addition, possibly other changelists have
					to be retransported because they also contain objects in the same DU.</p>

			<p class="p">When change recording is enabled in a system, the deletion of a package is not recorded as a
				change, since change recording only records changes to objects. You cannot transport
				a deleted package in a changelist when you use transport mode <span class="ph uicontrol">Selected
					Changelists</span> (native SAP HANA transport) or <span class="ph uicontrol">Released
					Changelists</span> (CTS transport). To bring the deletion of a package to
				the target system, you must transport <span class="ph uicontrol">All Changelists</span> in the
				DU (native SAP HANA transport) or <span class="ph uicontrol">Delivery Units</span> (CTS
				transport) from which the package was deleted. </p>

What will be the impact when I temporarily turn it off, for example, if there are deletion issues?">
			
			<p class="p">You should <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">switch on change recording only once</span>, ideally before you start
				your development. If you switch change recording off, all open changelists will be
				closed and not released. If you do this, you must make sure that you release and
				transport all open changelists beforehand. If you enable change recording again, the
				base changelist is created, which includes all active objects of DUs. This invisible
				changelist will be transported together with the first released changelist. You must
				therefore make sure that all active objects of the DU that exist in the source
				system are supposed to reach the target system. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="default.html?89b400379f994daaa0a65e9258cab8a7.html" target="_top" title="When you enable change recording in SAP HANA Application Lifecycle Management, all active objects of the system are included in a base changelist.">Technical Details of Initial Change Recording Setup</a>.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">I have transported a changelist with only a few objects, but now there are lots of objects in my target system. What happened?</div><div type="I have transported a changelist with only a few objects, but now there are lots of objects in my target system. What happened?">
			
			<p class="p">An important concept of <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> application lifecycle management is that it
				tries to <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">keep the target system consistent</span> with respect to the
				changes that were performed and released in the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">source system</span>.
				Therefore, a transport of individual changelists does not always include only the
				released changelists of a DU. It is possible that other objects are also part of the
				transport, of which you might not be aware. For example, the following objects can
				be included in a transport:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loioab01db5288554504a9127f6e231778b8__ul_jf4_x2y_jr">
				<li class="li">Objects contained in predecessor changelists of the selected changelist. If the system finds
					predecessor changelists, it does not allow you to transport the selected
					changelist without transporting the predecessors as well.<p class="p">For more
						information, see <a class="xref" href="default.html?883b782f714f4771bc5a19aff598a711.html" target="_top" title="For SAP HANA application lifecycle management, predecessor changelists are those that were released earlier than the selected changelists, which were not transported yet and that contain objects from the same packages.">Predecessor Changelists in SAP HANA Change Recording</a>.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li">Objects contained in the base changelist if this is the first transport of a changelist
					after change recording was enabled.<p class="p">If you enabled change recording after you
						started development, the base changelist contains all the active objects
						that exist for the DU at the point in time when change recording is enabled.
						It is created and transported together with the first transport of
						changelists for the DU.</p>
<p class="p">For more information, see <a class="xref" href="default.html?89b400379f994daaa0a65e9258cab8a7.html" target="_top" title="When you enable change recording in SAP HANA Application Lifecycle Management, all active objects of the system are included in a base changelist.">Technical Details of Initial Change Recording Setup</a>.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li"><span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> packages<p class="p">Packages are not normal transportable objects. They
						cannot be activated and they are always transported as metadata together
						with the DU. Whenever a DU archive is transported, the information about its
						packages is also transported. </p>
<p class="p">Therefore, if you delete a package and
						transport the changelist with the deletion invidually to the target system,
						the empty package will still be visible the target system. The deletion will
						only be effective when you transport the complete delivery unit.</p>

What is recommended?</div><div type="When can I use changelists spanning multiple DUs? What is the impact on transport and what do I need to keep in mind ? What is recommended?">
			
			<p class="p">In general, SAP recommends that you assign objects of only one DU to a changelist. If for some
				reason this is not possible and there are objects of more than one DU in the same
				changelist, then SAP recommends that you configure the transport route for the same
				DUs. If you transport the changelist using a transport route that is not configured
				for all DUs, only the objects in the assigned DUs will be transported. The objects
				in the other DU will not be transported.</p>

			<p class="p">For more information, see also <a class="xref" href="default.html?44a2013f2b8142fbb7285e99ce933544.html" target="_top" title="In general, we recommend that you assign objects of packages assigned to only one delivery unit (DU) to a changelist to ensure consistent transport of all objects in the changelist.">Recommendations on the Transport of Changelists</a>.</p>

What does this mean for upgrades, updates, and patches of SAP software?</div><div type="When I use change recording, DUs delivered by SAP are also recorded during import in customer systems. What does this mean for upgrades, updates, and patches of SAP software?">
			
			<p class="p">If upgrades, updates, or patches of <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> content are imported in a system
				in which change recording is enabled, this is also recorded in changelists. If the
				import finishes without errors, the changelists are immediately released. In order
				not to transport these changelists to the follow-on systems, you must ensure that
				the SAP DU is not included in any transport route (if you use native <span class="ph pname">SAP
					HANA</span> transport) or that the SAP DU is not assigned to CTS (if you use
				CTS transport). This way, you ensure that changelists with objects of DUs delivered
				by SAP are not offered for transport.</p>

			<p class="p">If the SAP DUs were imported with other tools, <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> Studio, for example,
				and the import failed, then it is possible that an open changelist exists in the
				system. If the import of the same DU is retried, the open changelist locks the DU,
				and the import cannot proceed. In this case, you must first release the changelist
				and then you can retry the import.</p>
